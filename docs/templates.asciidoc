== Openshift Dedicated Environment

Here are instructions for running examples on an Openshift Dedicated
environment.  For Dedicated, we have built a set of templates
that can be installed into a Dedicated instance to help automate
the creation of Crunchy Container Suite containers.

=== Example Details

Each example will build a template to be later used by
users when they want to deploy a Crunchy container.

The templates are installed by running the following script
within each example directory:

....
./run.sh
....

=== Badger

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-database-with-pgbadger*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/badger
....

This template will create the following:
 * database container (emptyDir)
 * pgbadger container
 * database service

=== Metrics Collection

Template Name is *crunchy-metrics-backend-using-ebs*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/collect
....

This template will create the following:
 * database container (emptyDir)
 * collect container
 * database service

This example will pull postgres metrics from the database
and push them to the metrics backend.

=== Metrics Collection and Badger Analysis

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-database-with-collect-badger*
Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-database-with-collect-badger-pvc*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/master-collect-badger
....

This template will create the following:
 * master database container (emptyDir or PVC)
 * collect container
 * badger container
 * master database service

This example will pull postgres metrics from the database
and push them to the metrics backend as well as provide
a pgbadger container for log analysis.

=== Restore Database

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-database-restore-emptydir*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/master-restore
....

This template will create the following:
 * database container (emptyDir)
 * database service

This example performs a database restore using a backup archive
found in a PVC.

=== Master - Replica Database Cluster

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-master-replica-emptydir*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/master-replica
....

This template will create the following:
 * database container as the master (emptyDir)
 * database container as the replica (emptyDir)
 * database service for the master
 * database service for the replica

This example deploys a master-replica configuration
which uses emptyDir for persistence. 

=== Master - Replica Database Cluster using DeploymentConfig for Replica

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-master-replica-deployment-emptydir*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/master-slave-dc
....

This template will create the following:
 * database container as the master (emptyDir)
 * DeploymentConfig for the replica (emptyDir) allowing scaling
 * database service for the master
 * database service for the replica

This example deploys a master-slave configuration
which uses emptyDir for persistence.  The DeploymentConfig allows
you to scale up the number of replica containers.

=== Metrics 

Template Name is *crunchy-metrics-backend-using-ebs*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/metrics
....

This template will create the following:
 * prometheus container (PVC for persistence)
 * grafana container (PVC for persistence)
 * promgateway container  
 * services for prometheus, grafana, and promgateway

This example deploys all the required metrics containers
which are used to store and visualize collected postgres metrics.
The example uses a single PVC to store all the metrics and
dashboard data.

=== pgadmin4 

Template Name is *crunchy-pgadmin4-ebs*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/pgadmin4
....

This template will create the following:
 * pgadmin4 container (PVC for persistence)
 * service for pgadmin4

This example deploys the pgadmin4 container and uses
a PVC to persist the data.


=== pgpool 

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-pgpool-template*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/pgpool
....

This template will create the following:
 * pgpool container within a DeploymentConfig
 * service for pgpool

This example deploys the pgpool container and service.  The DeploymentConfig
allows you to scale up the pgpool container.

=== single master database 

Template names are *crunchy-postgres-database-emptydir* and
*crunchy-postgres-database-pvc*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/single-master
....

These templates create the following:
 * master database container using emptyDir volume or a PVC
 * service for database 

This example deploys a single database container which
uses emptyDir or a PVC for volume persistence.

=== replica with DeploymentConfig

Template names is *crunchy-postgres-replica-deployment-emptydir*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/replica-dc
....

These templates create the following:
 * replica database container using emptyDir volume and a DeploymentConfig
   allowing scaling
 * service for replica 

This example deploys a single replica container which
uses emptyDir that can be scaled up within a DeploymentConfig.

=== database backup

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-database-backup*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/backup
....

This template will create the following:
 * Job which generates a backup container

This example deploys a Job which results in a Pod
created which will run the crunchy-backup container.  It
will create a backup of a database and store the backup
files in a PVC.

=== replica database

Template names are *crunchy-postgres-replica-emptydir* and
*crunchy-postgres-replica-pvc*.

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/single-replica
....

This template will create the following:
 * replica database container using emptyDir or PVC as the data volume
 * service to the replica

This example deploys a replica database pod using either
emptyDir or a PVC to store data.  A service is also
created to the replica.

=== synchronous replica database

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-master-sync-replica-pvc*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/sync
....

This template will create the following:
 * PVC for the master database
 * PVC for the replica database
 * master database container using PVC as the data volume
 * replica database container using PVC as the data volume
 * service to the master database
 * service to the replica database

This example deploys a database pod using a PVC to store data.  
A service is also created to the database.  This example creates
a synchronous replica.

=== watch

Template Name is *crunchy-cluster-watch-template*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/watch
....

This template will create the following:
 * watch pod for watching a database cluster

This example deploys a watch pod that watches a database
master, if the master dies, it will trigger a failover to
a replica.  This pod uses a ServiceAccount which is required
to be defined.
