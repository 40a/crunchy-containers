== Gluster Setup for General Testing

This document describes how to setup a 3 node Gluster
cluster which can be used to test dynamic storage
on a Kube or Openshift deployment concurrently.

Each VM has the following resources:

* centos 7 minimal
* 2 GB memory
* 20 GB host disk
* 20 GB host disk dedicated for Gluster
* 1 CPU

You will end up with IP addresses and names similar to this:
....
192.168.122.40 gluster1
192.168.122.20 gluster3
192.168.122.102 gluster2
....

These VMs will need a stable IP address that resolves on each host with each other as above.  Update the */etc/hosts* on each VM to include all 3 VM IP addresses.

=== Install Dependencies
On each VM, install the dependencies:
....
yum -y update
yum -y install centos-release-gluster310
yum -y install glusterfs gluster-cli glusterfs-libs glusterfs-server
systemctl enable glusterd
systemctl start glusterd
....

=== Choose the Heketi Host
Heketi is a REST API for Gluster used to provide connectivity from Kube to Gluster, it only needs to run on a single host, for this tutorial, install it on the gluster1 VM as follows:
....
yum -y install epel-release
yum -y install heketi-client heketi
....

=== Only For Testing
I tend to shutdown selinux and make sure firewalld is not running when I develop with stuff like this, you would of course take a different approach when running a production system.
....
systemctl disable firewalld.service
systemctl stop firewalld.service
Vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux and disable enforcement
reboot
....

=== Gluster Disk Setup
On each gluster host, you need a clean unused disk dedicated to Gluster, for this tutorial I use kvm, and created a 20GB disk which on the VM is found at */dev/vdb*, adjust this to whatever disk path you end up provisioning.

=== SSH Setup
On each host I added this line to /etc/sudoers
....
Defaults   requiretty
....

After that change restart sshd:
....
systemctl restart sshd
....

On the Heketi host (gluster1), create a key like this:
....
ssh-keygen -f /etc/heketi/heketi_key -t rsa -N 'â€™
....

Copy that key like this to the other hosts:
....
ssh-copy-id -i /etc/heketi/heketi_key root@gluster2
ssh-copy-id -i /etc/heketi/heketi_key root@gluster3
ssh-copy-id -i /etc/heketi/heketi_key root@gluster1
....
The requirement here is to have password-less sudo as the root user using that key to all the gluster nodes!

*Only install heketi on gluster1 in this example.*

=== Heketi Setup
Sample heketi configuration files are found in the github docs/gluster directory.  Copy the heketi.json, and topologo-sample.json to /etc/heketi on the gluster1 node.

*Update the topology-sample.json file to specify your VMs IP addresses and your Gluster disk paths.*

=== Load the Topology
....
export HEKETI_CLI_SERVER=http://gluster1:8080
heketi-cli topology load --json=/etc/heketi/topology-sample.json
....

You can run some heketi CLI commands to see what was just created
for you based on your topology-sample.json file:
....
heketi-cli topology info
heketi-cli cluster list
heketi-cli volume list
heketi-cli volume info
heketi-cli cluster info
....

=== Setup the Kube or Openshift Host for Gluster

On your Kube or Openshift host, install the Gluster dependencies:
....
yum -y install centos-release-gluster310
Yum -y install epel-release
yum -y install heketi-client
yum -y install glusterfs
yum -y install glusterfs-server glusterfs-fuse glusterfs-cli
....

=== Define the Gluster Heketi Host
*In /etc/hosts add an entry for the gluster1 host*

=== Create the storage class on Kube

Copy the sample gluster-storage-class.yaml file from the github
docs/gluster folder to your Kube or Openshift host and execute the following:
....
kubectl create -f gluster-storage-class.yaml
kubectl get sc
....

This will create a storage class you can then use within your PVCs.

=== Create a Test PVC 

An example PVC using this StorageClass is found in the github docs/gluster
folder:
....
kubectl create -f test-pvc.json
kubectl get pvc test-pvc
....

== Testing 

With this sort of standalone Gluster deployment, you can now
test the Container Suite on Kube and Openshift, and also test
the Postgres Operator all using the same Gluster cluster.  You
only have to setup and maintain a single Gluster cluster.
