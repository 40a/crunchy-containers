== Prerequsites

You will need to do the following steps prior to testing.

*Note*: If version numbers have not been updated, you will need update version numbers in documentation and examples in your test instance.

It is recommended to build a clean virtual machine for all three applications (Docker, OpenShift, Kubernetes) on both operating systems (CentOS 7, RHEL 7). This will ensure the most accurate results from testing.

 * Build a clean Docker CentOS 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean OpenShift CentOS 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean Kubernetes CentOS 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean Docker RHEL 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean OpenShift RHEL 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean Kubernetes RHEL 7 host (VM)

At this point, you can build the 9.5 and 9.6 images on all three hosts. (Or if you're testing a new PostgreSQL release, you can build those at this point also.)

 * Build the 9.5 and 9.6 images on the new Docker host
 * Build the 9.5 and 9.6 images on the new OpenShift host
 * Build the 9.5 and 9.6 images on the new Kubernetes host

== New Container Release Testing

The following examples are used to test each environment:

 * basic
 * backup
 * restore
 * grafana/prometheus/promgateway
 * collect example
 * master-replica
 * pgpool
 * pgbouncer
 * crunchy-proxy
 * sync example
