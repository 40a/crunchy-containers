== Prerequsites

You will need to do the following steps prior to testing.

*Note*: If version numbers have not been updated, you will need update version numbers in documentation and examples in your test instance.

It is recommended to build a clean virtual machine for all three applications (Docker, OpenShift, Kubernetes) on both operating systems (CentOS 7, RHEL 7).
This will ensure the most accurate results from testing.

If you wanted a more automated (or at least faster) way of setting these up, two shell scripts have been provided in the /docs directory, link:https://github.com/xenophenes/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/setup-env.sh[setup-env.sh]
and link:https://github.com/xenophenes/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/setup-env-2.sh[setup-env-2.sh]. Ensure setup-env.sh has the proper version numbers for what you are testing, and run that script first; then after following the
instructions it outputs, run setup-env-2.sh.

 * Build a clean Docker CentOS 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean OpenShift CentOS 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean Kubernetes CentOS 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean Docker RHEL 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean OpenShift RHEL 7 host (VM)
 * Build a clean Kubernetes RHEL 7 host (VM)

At this point, you can build the 9.5 and 9.6 images on all three hosts. (Or if you're testing a new PostgreSQL release, you can build those at this point also.)

 * Build the 9.5 and 9.6 images on the new Docker host
 * Build the 9.5 and 9.6 images on the new OpenShift host
 * Build the 9.5 and 9.6 images on the new Kubernetes host

== Container Release Testing

The following examples are used to test each environment. This applies to whether you're testing a new PostgreSQL release or a new Container Suite release.

For each container, a link is added below that corresponds to the link:https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/examples.adoc[Examples Documentation]. Follow the steps for each, and verify that everything is running successfully. 

An example using the *basic* container of how you would both run the container on all three applications and verify it is running successfully is as follows:

*Docker*

Create the container:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/docker/basic
./run.sh
....

Start the instance:
....
docker start basic
....

Connect to the local host and verify you can connect and execute queries successfully:
....
psql -h localhost -p 12000 -U testuser -W userdb
....

Shut down the instance:
....
docker stop basic
....

*Kubernetes*

Running the example:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/basic
./run.sh
....

You can verify that everything is running successfully by using the following commands:

....
kubectl get pod basic
kubectl get service basic
kubectl logs basic
....

After the database starts up you can connect to it as follows:
....
psql -h basic -U postgres postgres
....

*OpenShift*

Running the example:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/openshift/basic
./run.sh
....

You can see what passwords were generated by running this command:

....
oc describe pod basic | grep PG
....

You can run the following command to test the database, entering
the value of PG_PASSWORD from above for the password when prompted:

....
psql -h basic.openshift.svc.cluster.local -U testuser userdb
....
