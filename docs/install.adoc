== Project Setup & Docker Installation

The crunchy-containers can run on different environments including:

 * Standalone Docker
 * OpenShift Enterprise
 * Kubernetes 1.2.X

In this document we list the basic installation steps required for these
environments.

=== Assumptions

The install assumes the following about your host configuration:

 * Centos 7 or RHEL 7 VM
 * user called *someuser* has been created
 * *someuser* has sudo privileges with no password

=== Step 1 - Project Directory Structure

First add the following lines to your .bashrc file to set
the project paths:
....
export GOPATH=$HOME/cdev
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
export CCP_BASEOS=centos7
export CCP_PGVERSION=9.6
export CCP_VERSION=1.4.1
export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=$CCP_BASEOS-$CCP_PGVERSION-$CCP_VERSION
export CCPROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
....
You will then need to log out and back in for the changes to your .bashrc
file to take effect.

Next, set up a project directory structure and pull down the project:
....
mkdir $HOME/cdev $HOME/cdev/src $HOME/cdev/pkg $HOME/cdev/bin
cd $GOPATH
sudo yum -y install golang git docker postgresql
go get github.com/tools/godep
cd src/github.com
mkdir crunchydata
cd crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-containers
cd crunchy-containers
git checkout 1.4.1
godep restore
....

*If you are a Crunchy enterprise customer, you will place the CRUNCHY repo
key and yum repo file into the $CCPROOT/conf directory at this point. These
files can be obtained through https://access.crunchydata.com/ on the downloads
page.*

=== Step 2 - Install the Host Dependencies

Next, install system dependencies:
....
sudo yum -y update
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker someuser
....

Remember to log out of the *someuser* account for the Docker group
to be added to your current session.  Once it's added, you'll be able
to run Docker commands from your user account.
....
su - someuser
....

You can ensure your *someuser* account is added correctly by running the following
command and ensuring *docker* appears as one of the results:
....
groups
....

Before you start Docker, you might consider configuring Docker storage:
This is described if you run:
....
man docker-storage-setup
....

Follow the instructions available link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/install_config/install/host_preparation.html#configuring-docker-storage[on the main OpenShift documentation page]
to configure Docker storage appropriately.

My typical process for setting up Docker storage is as follows:

 * add an extra IDE drive to my VM
 * fdisk /dev/sd? to format the drive
 * vgcreate docker-vg /dev/sd?1 to create a volume group on the new drive partition
 * add VG=docker-vg to /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup
 * run docker-storage-setup to use that new volume group

Next, we enable and start up Docker:
....
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl start docker.service
....

=== Step 3 - Build the Containers

At this point, you have a decision to make - either download prebuilt
containers from link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], *or* build the containers on your local host.

To download the prebuilt containers, make sure you can login to
link:https://hub.docker.com/[Dockerhub], and then run the following:
....
docker login
cd $CCPROOT
./bin/pull-from-dockerhub.sh
....

Or if you'd rather build the containers from source, perform a container
build as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT
make setup
make all
....

After this, you will have all the Crunchy containers built and are ready
for use in a *standalone Docker* environment.

== OpenShift Environment

=== Installation

See the OSE installation guide for details on how to install
OSE on your host.  The main instructions are here:

https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/install_config/install/index.html

*Or*, if you'd prefer to install OpenShift Origin, the easiest way to get
OpenShift Origin up and running is found here:
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md

For examples and tips on how to run OpenShift Enterprise & Origin, please look
at the examples.adoc documentation.

=== Configure NFS for Persistence

NFS is required for some of the OpenShift examples, those dealing with
backups and restores will require a working NFS for example.

First, if you are running your NFS system with SELinux
in enforcing mode, you will need to run the following command
to allow NFS write permissions:
....
sudo setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1
....

Next, you will need to set the permissions of your NFS
path so that your pods can have write access.  For the
Crunchy examples, the *nfsnobody* GUI was chosen as
an example.  Pods will reference the *nfsnobody* GID (65534)
as a security context *supplementalGroup* attribute.  This
setting will allow the pod to have group permissions of 65534
and therefore be able to write to the NFS persistent volumes.

The permissions on the NFS path are set as follows:
....
drwxrwx---.   3 nfsnobody nfsnobody   23 Dec 16 11:28 nfsfileshare
....

Most of the Crunchy containers run as the postgres UID (26), but you
will notice that when *supplementalGroups* are specified, the pod
will include the nfsnobody group in the list of groups for the pod user.

The case of Amazon file systems is different, for that you use the
*fsGroup* security context setting but the idea for allowing
write permissions is the same.

Here are the instructions I use when setting up NFS:

http://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/how-to-setup-nfs-server-on-centos-7-rhel-7-fedora-22.html

OpenShift NFS examples can be found here:

https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/wordpress/nfs

The examples specify a test NFS server running at IP address 192.168.0.103.

On that server, the /etc/exports file looks like this:

....
/nfsfileshare *(rw,sync)
....

Test your NFS configuration out by mounting a local directory:
....
mount 192.168.0.114:/nfsfileshare /mnt/nfsfileshare
....

if you are running your client on a VM, you will need to
add 'insecure' to the exportfs file on the NFS server, this is because
of the way port translation is done between the VM host and the VM instance.

see this for more details:

http://serverfault.com/questions/107546/mount-nfs-access-denied-by-server-while-mounting

=== Examples


For running the examples that require persistent volumes, you
will need to run the following script:
....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/pv
./create-pv.sh
./create-pvc.sh
....

View the README.txt for command-line usage.

If you are wanting to run the examples on a Minishift instance
you will need to create the PVs using hostPath as follows:
....
oc login -u system:admin
./create-pv.sh hostpath
oc login -u developer
./create-pvc.sh
....

Additional steps are required to allow persistence to work
on Minishift including:
....
oc login -u system:admin
oc edit scc restricted
....

Above, you will change runAsUser.Type strategy to RunAsAny.

On the boot2docker instance running Minishift, you will need
to set the host path permissions as follows:
....
chmod 777 /mnt/sda1/data
....


The NAMESPACE environment variable is set to indicate which OpenShift
project you want various example objects to use.  This variable
is set to *default* within the *examples/envvars.sh* script.  Set this
to match your project configuration.

See link:examples.adoc[here] to view the documentation showing various
examples.

== Kubernetes Environment

=== Installation

I recommend using kubeadm or minikube to try the examples out.

See the following links for installation instructions:

 * https://github.com/Kubernetes/minikube
 * http://linoxide.com/containers/setup-kubernetes-kubeadm-centos/
 * https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/

=== Examples

The namespace is set for the examples within the *examples/envvars.sh* script
and defaults to *default*.  Set this variable according to your
project configuration.

Note, some of the examples assume an NFS file system for creating
persistent volumes.  See above for details on setting NFS permissions and
the use of *supplementalGroups* within pod specs.

Visit the link:examples.adoc[examples documentation] for different use cases
and examples.

===  Tips

Make sure your hostname resolves to a single IP address in your
/etc/hosts file!  If not, the NFS examples will not work.

You should see a single IP address returned from this command:
....
hostname --ip-address
....

....
sudo PATH=$PATH ALLOW_PRIVILEGED=true ./hack/local-up-cluster.sh
....

Note:  specifying ALLOW_PRIVILEGED=true is required if you are running
in SELinux enforcing mode. This allows you to specify the following
in your pod spec to run the container as privileged:
....
"securityContext": {
	"privileged": true
},
....
