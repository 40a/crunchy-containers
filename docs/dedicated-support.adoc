=== Supported PostgreSQL Authentication

The PostgreSQL md5 user authentication method is supported.

=== Supported PostgreSQL Database Size

PostgresSQL database sizes up to 1 TB are supported.

=== Supported Openshift Persistence Technologies

The Crunchy Container templates will work with any Openshift supported
persistence technology provided that the template is modified to support
either the Security Context *fsGroup* or *supplementalGroups* attribute.
This modification will need to be made by a Redhat administrator
when the Crunchy templates are used for a given customer deployment.

=== Supported Container Customizations

Currently Crunchy doesn't offer support for modified versions
of the Crunchy Containers or the Crunchy provided Openshift
templates. 

Use of the currently defined Openshift Template variables is supported.

=== Release Life Cycle

Crunchy provides new container updates in these cases:

 * new features are added
 * bugs are found and require a fix
 * security vulnerabilities are found
 * new versions of Postgres are released

In these cases, Crunchy builds new containers and makes them
available on a Crunchy Docker Registry that is accessible only
to customers or vendors with special access to that registry.

Email announcements are created and sent to customers when a new
release is made available.

The containers are built on a RHEL 7 base Docker image.  Images
are built that include either the PostgreSQL 9.5 version or the
PostgreSQL 9.6 version.  Customers can choose which version of 
PostgreSQL they want to run by using the specific tagged version
of the container, for example, the Crunchy PostgreSQL 9.5 container
has a tag of *rhel7-9.5-1.4.1* which means this is a RHEL based
container that includes the PostgreSQL version 9.5 components and
is at version 1.4.1 of the Crunchy code base.

=== Supported Configurations of the Crunchy Containers

The following container deployments are supported by Crunchy in
an Openshift Dedicated installation:

==== Single PostgreSQL Master

This is a single PostgreSQL container running as a *master*.  This
is deployed using the *master* template.  This will deploy
a PostgreSQL database that users can access and read/write data
to.  This configuration is the most simple deployment example.

Each master database writes to a unique PVC as specified in the 
provided Openshift template.

==== PostgreSQL Replica

Customers might require a read-only PostgreSQL replica database.  This
use case lets customers deploy a single PostgreSQL container
that acts as a replica to a currently running PostgreSQL master containers.

Each replica writes its data to a unique PVC that is specified in the
Openshift template that is provided.

As more replicas are required, they can be deployed one-by-one by a
customer.  When dynamic storage is supported by Openshift Dedicated,
more sophisticated deployment models will be made possible.

==== PostgreSQL Backup

A full database backup is supported using the Crunchy Backup container
and provided template.  This template when executed will create a
unique full database backup using the PostgreSQL *pg_basebackup* utility.
The backup will be written to a unique PVC that will hold the backup
files.  The Backup is run as a Job and when the backup is completed
the Job and Pod are left in a completed state.

==== pgadmin4 Container

Users that want a PostgreSQL aware GUI interface to their database
containers can deploy a pgadmin4 container.  Once deployed, the users
will need to enter connection details about their database containers
in order to access them via the pgadmin4 user interface.

=== Support Life Cycle

==== Phase 1: Full Support

Crunchy will provide full support for Crunchy Containers deployed within
the Redhat Openshift Dedicated environment to valid subscribers for the
duration of their subscription.  This level of support applies to any
version of the Crunchy Container Suite for as long as the customer
requires support.
