 * Docker 1.12 and above
 * Openshift 3.4 and above
 * Kubernetes 1.5 and above

=== Containers

The project includes the following containers:

 * link:/container-specifications/#_crunchy_postgres[crunchy-postgres] - executes Postgres
 * link:/container-specifications/#_crunchy_postgres-gis[crunchy-postgres-gis] - executes Postgres plus the PostGIS extensions
 * link:/container-specifications/#_crunchy_backup[crunchy-backup] - performs a full database backup
 * link:/container-specifications/#_crunchy_pgpool[crunchy-pgpool] - executes pgpool
 * link:/container-specifications/#_crunchy_pgbadger[crunchy-pgbadger] - executes pgbadger
 * link:/container-specifications/#_crunchy_watch[crunchy-watch] - performs a form of automated failover
 * link:/container-specifications/#_crunchy_collect[crunchy-collect] - collects Postgres metrics

For Kubernetes users of these containers, there is an associated
project worth taking a look at that uses the containers found
in this repo and provides a higher level automation.
That project is the link:https://github.com/crunchydata/postgres-operator[postgres-operator].

Further descriptions of each of these containers and environment variables that can be used to tune them
can be found in the link:/container-specifications/[Container Specifications] document.

== Getting Started

Complete build and install documentation is found link:/installation/[here].  The provided Dockerfiles build the containers
on a Centos 7 base image and use the community PostgreSQL RPMs.

Crunchy provides a commercially supported version of these containers
built upon RHEL 7 and the Crunchy supported PostgreSQL. Contact Crunchy
for more details at http://www.crunchydata.com.

== Usage

Various examples are provided in link:/getting-started/[the Getting Started documentation] for running in Docker,
Kubernetes, and OpenShift environments.

You will need to set up your environment as per the link:/installation/[Installation documentation] in order to
execute the examples.
