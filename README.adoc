This project includes a set of Dockerfiles that lets you build
the Crunchy Certified PostgreSQL Docker containers. 

The containers will execute in the following environments:

 * Standalone - a pure Docker environment
 * Openshift 3.x
 * Kubernetes 1.2.X

The project includes the following containers:

 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-postgres[crunchy-postgres] - executes Postgres
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-backup[crunchy-backup] - performs a full database backup
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-pgpool[crunchy-pgpool] - executes pgpool
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-pgbadger[crunchy-pgbadger] - executes pgbadger
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-watch[crunchy-watch] - performs a form of automated failover
 * link:docs/metrics.asciidoc#crunchy-collect[crunchy-collect] - collects Postgres metrics
 * link:docs/metrics.asciidoc#crunchy-prometheus[crunchy-prometheus] -stores Postgres metrics
 * link:docs/metrics.asciidoc#crunchy-grafana[crunchy-grafana] - graphs Postgres metrics
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-dns[crunchy-dns] - standalone DNS server useful for standalone execution
 * link:docs/containers.asciidoc#crunchy-pgbouncer[crunchy-pgbouncer] - pgbouncer connection pooler and simple form of failover

=== Build Prerequisites

These containers have been tested on Centos 7, RHEL 7, Openshift 3.1,
Kubernetes 1.2.4, and Docker 1.8/1.9.

1) Installing / configuring Docker

On an EL7 system, docker can be installed with the following commands:

 * sudo yum -y install docker
 * sudo groupadd docker
 * sudo usermod -a -G docker ${USER} 
 * sudo systemctl enable docker;systemctl start docker
 * TIP:  remember to log out $USER for the docker group to take effect!

2) Installing / configuring Go

On RHEL systems, "Go" can be installed with the following command:

 * subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
 * sudo yum -y install golang

3) Building the Containers (Optional)

If you don't want to pull the containers from link:https://hub.docker.com/u/crunchydata/dashboard/[DockerHub] or the
private Crunchy Docker registry, you can perform a build of
all the containers locally on your development host.

Complete install documentation is found here: link:docs/install.asciidoc[Install Docs]

5) Setting up config files for compilation

In order to compile the openshift-dedicated-container code for RHEL, two files must be placed in the conf directory:

 * crunchypg95.repo or crunchypg93.repo
 * CRUNCHY-GPG-KEY.public

Both of these files can be obtained with the following procedure:

 * Request an account on access.crunchydata.com
 * Go to https://access.crunchydata.com/
 * In the upper-right, click "Customer Log In"
 * Enter your provided username and password
 * Click "submit"
 * Read the terms of use and click "I agree"
 * Change your password (first login) by Clicking on "Profile" in the upper right; enter your old password, a new password, and click "Change password"
 * Click on "Downloads" in the upper right corner
 * The "Download GPG Key" button will automatically download the CRUNCHY-GPG-KEY.public file
 * The "Download repo file (RHEL)" button will automatically download a personalized (to your user) crunchypg95.repo file

=== Examples

Various examples are provided in the /examples directory and described
in the documentation for running Standalone and Openshift examples..

=== Testing

There is a small test suite to test out your initial installation, you
run it with the following command:

....
make test
....

Testing openshift is performed as follows:
....
make testopenshift
