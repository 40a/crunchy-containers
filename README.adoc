=== Build Prerequisites

These containers have been tested on Centos 7, RHEL 7, Openshift 3.1,
Kubernetes 1.2.4, and Docker 1.8/1.9.

1) Installing / configuring Docker

On an EL7 system, docker can be installed with the following commands:

 * sudo yum -y install docker
 * sudo groupadd docker
 * sudo usermod -a -G docker ${USER} 
 * sudo systemctl enable docker;systemctl start docker
 * TIP:  remember to log out $USER for the docker group to take effect!

2) Installing / configuring Go

On RHEL systems, "Go" can be installed with the following command:

 * subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
 * sudo yum -y install golang

3) Building the Containers (Optional)

If you don't want to pull the containers from link:https://hub.docker.com/u/crunchydata/dashboard/[DockerHub], you can perform a build of
all the containers locally on your development host.

Complete build and install documentation is found here: link:docs/install.asciidoc[Install Docs].  The provided Dockerfiles build the containers
on a Centos 7 base image and use the community PostgreSQL RPMs.  

Crunchy provides a commercially supported version of these containers
built upon RHEL 7 and the Crunchy supported PostgreSQL.  Contact Crunchy
for more details at link:http://www.crunchydata.com.

=== Examples

Various examples are provided in the /examples directory and described
in the documentation for running Standalone and Openshift examples..

To run the examples, you will need to set the CCP_IMAGE_TAG
environment variable which indicates which version of the 
container you will pull down and execute, for example:
....
export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-9.5-1.2.2
....

=== Testing

There is a small test suite to test out your initial installation, you
run it with the following command:

....
make test
....

Testing openshift is performed as follows:
....
make testopenshift
....
