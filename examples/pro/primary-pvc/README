this example assumes you will create on Openshift Pro a
PVC named 'crunchy-pgdata-pvc-for-primary' using the Openshift
web console prior to running this 'run.sh' script.

After you run 'run.sh', it will create a pod named 'primary', and
a service named 'primary'.


You can also use the template.json with OpenShift and not worry about the binding.
To use it as a template in the web "add to project view" do the following commands in your project:

  oc create -f ./template.json

This will make the template show up under "uncategorized" in the Add to Project overview catalog.

If you want to just accept all the default values in the template and get PostGIS quickly you can just do:

  oc new-app -f ./template.json
