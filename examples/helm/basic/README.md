Crunchy Data Basic Helm Example
=======

[PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.


TL;DR;
------

```console
$ helm install basic --name basic
```

Introduction
------------

This is an example of running the Crunchy PostgreSQL containers using the Helm project! More examples of the Crunchy Containers for PostgreSQL can be found at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers).

This example will create the following in your Kubernetes cluster:

 * Create a pod named *crunchy-basic*
 * Create a service named *crunchy-basic*
 * Create a release named *crunchy-basic*
 * Initialize the database using the predefined environment variables

This example creates a simple PostgreSQL streaming replication deployment with a single primary (read-write).

Installing the Chart
--------------------

The chart can be installed as follows:

```console
$ helm install basic --name basic
```

The command deploys both primary and replica pods on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

Using the Chart
----------------------

After the database starts up you can connect to it as follows:
....
psql -h crunchy-basic -U postgres postgres
....

Uninstalling the Chart
----------------------

To uninstall/delete the `basic` deployment:

```console
$ helm del --purge basic
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

Configuration
-------------

See `values.yaml` for configuration notes. Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
$ helm install basic --name basic \
  --set env.debug=false
```

The above command disables the debugging.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
$ helm install basic --name basic  \
  -f values.yaml
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)
